## 🛍️ Theft & Violence in Retail Shops

- **Shrink** is the loss metric in retail due to theft or other causes.
- In 2022, retail shrink hit **$112.1 billion**, up from **$93.9 billion** in 2021.
- Theft (internal & external) makes up **65-70%** of shrink.
- **Organized Retail Crime (ORC)** has become increasingly violent.
  - **81%** report ORC offenders are more violent than previous years.
  - **67%** say violence is increasing year over year.

## 💻 Model Architecture

> Vision Transformer (ViT) based architecture is used for:
- Action recognition
- Anomaly detection
- Person classification in video streams

## ⚙️ Working of My Project

The current project enhances retail surveillance by processing uploaded videos through a **Google Colab-based system**.  
Users upload videos via a **Streamlit web interface**, which triggers the `EnhancedRetailSurveillanceSystem` to analyze the frames using **VideoMAE**.  

- 🧍 **Person Detection**: Detected using HOG and motion-based methods  
- 🧭 **Tracking**: Implemented with a custom `PersonTracker`  
- 🏷️ **Behavior Classification**: Uses a 16-frame buffer to classify behaviors into:  
  - ✅ Normal  
  - ❓ Suspicious  
  - 😡 Aggressive  
  - 💥 Violence  
  - 🛍️ Theft  

### ✅ Output:
- Annotated frames with bounding boxes  
- Detected actions & statistics (e.g., "Violence Detected")  
- Results saved to **Google Drive**  
- Displayed on the Streamlit dashboard as **"Normal" or "Violence Detected"**

## ✅ Conclusion

Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer a powerful approach for modern video surveillance. Leveraging ViTs allows:
- Real-time threat detection
- Enhanced object and activity understanding
- Actionable insights for decision-making

> However, ethical implementation is essential — privacy-preserving techniques and bias mitigation must be integrated to ensure responsible usage.
